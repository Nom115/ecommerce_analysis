## Installation 

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation 

This project is part of my business/data analysis portfolio. The project aims to apply CRISP-DM process in analytics of data of my choice. I have chosen the [E-Commerce Data]. Using this data I have tried to answer the following questions:

1. What is the total sales and profit for each category and sub-category?
2. Is there a correlation between the sales target and the actual sales achieved for each month?
2. Can we predict the future sales based on historical data?

## File Descriptions

There is one Jupyter Notebook file that contains all the analytics and codes. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results

You can find brief results below: 

1. What is the total sales and profit for each category and sub-category?

Based on the graphical representation, it is evident that the sub-category exhibiting the highest performance is "Printers," while the sub-category demonstrating the lowest performance is "Tables." Consequently, it can be inferred that the overarching category of 'Furniture' represents the lowest performing category, while 'Electronics' stands out as the highest performing category. 

2. Is there a correlation between the sales target and the actual sales achieved for each month?

The examination of the correlation between sales targets and actual sales for each month reveals a noteworthy insight: it appears that the established sales targets did not exert a substantial influence on the actual sales achieved. This divergence could be attributed to various factors, such as the potential setting of unrealistic or mismatched targets, overlooking external influences like market conditions, competition, or unforeseen events, all of which can sway sales outcomes significantly. Additionally, the observation of underperforming categories underscores the importance of identifying and addressing weaknesses within the business, facilitating targeted improvements to enhance overall sales performance.

3. Can we predict the future sales based on historical data?

 The assertion that the most critical factor is the city indicates that geographic location plays a significant role in sales performance. This insight suggests that investing resources, marketing efforts, and sales strategies in the highest-performing cities could yield the most substantial return on investment.
